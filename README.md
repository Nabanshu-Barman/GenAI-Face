The gender_dataset_face is the image dataset used to train the model. The train.py file is responsible for creating the trained model, which is saved as gender_detection.h5. The app.py script utilizes this trained model and a webcam to determine whether the person in front of the camera is male or female. The templates folder contains the index.html for the locally hosted website that runs the project. The application uses the webcam to detect gender and provides a percentage reading of whether the person is male or female.
